CONCEPT:
You are an in a box with tons of flying and bouncing objects
You need to survive
each level has more objects in it


TODO:
- improve movement
- add zone circle
- anti gravity powerups and negative powerups
- stuff happens if you hit different colors
- use delta so it objects do not move faster on higher refresh rates
- when you lose, make other balls form something like "GG"?
- use .hidden class instead of changing opacity and z-index styles
